Add up the total number of minutes second and hours of all the videos

for the exercise, Wes replicated what youtube has - has dom nodes with data-time attribtues containing the minutes & seconds 

going to be using REDUCE
-use map and reduce
-use just reduce

need to make sure we parse the strings and turn them into floats
reduce takes in an array and returns anything you want

remember that the mod operator gives us the remainder %

review:
we took the array of nodes, we converted the dataset from time to minutes to seconds
converted seconds to whole number of seconds and added it all together
