game will be 10 seconds left, click for points

first need a function that gives us a random amount of time to spawn the moles
need a second function to pick random hole to spawn mole
-holes is a nodelist
-select a random index btw 1 and 5

'isTrusted' - you can fake clicks, so we have a conditional to stop and not give the user a point
