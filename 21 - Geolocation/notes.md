Going to be dealing with geolocation - not just lat/long
Also going to be dealing with heading and speed
-heading is essentially a compass

Going to use an iOS simnulator and xCode
-in chrome we can fake coordinates but not heading or speed

localhost is a secure origin, but because we want to open the app on an external device we need to use an external address
browsersync ships with a self signed certificate which allows you to use HTTPS on your computer

select both the arrow and km/h

watch position gives us refreshes of data
accuracy - number of meters close to
heading degrees relative to north
lat/long
speed - km/h

rotate the camera based on where we are using css rotate
