countdown timer 

setInterval sometimes has problems running and has issues with iOS in some cases

store interval in its own variable

setInterval doesn't run immediately, it has to wait for the first second to elapse,
so we create a second function displayTimeLeft that takes ins econds

use of timestamps and booleans in math to handle end time

can also use document.customForm (customForm is the name of our form in this case)
-document.customForm.mintues
